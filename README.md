### Problem Statement ID - SIH1644

### Problem Statement Title - A web application specifically designed for Indian coal mines to quantify their carbon footprint and explore pathways to carbon neutrality.

## Description 
Background: India faces a complex challenge in balancing its reliance on coal for energy with its climate change commitments. Coal mining is a major source of carbon emissions, a greenhouse gas contributing to global warming. To achieve carbon neutrality, the Indian coal sector needs to offset its emissions. This can be done through a combination of strategies like reducing emissions from mining activities, adopting cleaner technologies, and offsetting remaining emissions by planting trees that absorb carbon dioxide. A web-based application can be a powerful tool in this journey by helping quantify a mine's carbon footprint and evaluate potential pathways to carbon neutrality. Description: The web based application will have following objectives: Activity wise quantification of Carbon emission in Coal Mines Estimation of existing Carbon Sinks Gap analysis between C emission and sinks and suggesting pathways to carbon neutrality Expected Solution: A comprehensive software solution that includes: Emission estimation: The app would allow users to input data on various mining activities (e.g., excavation, transportation, equipment usage) and estimate the associated carbon emissions based on establishd emission factors. Estimation of Per Capita emissions of a Mine. Carbon Neutrality Pathways: The app could offer features for simulating different emission reduction strategies like: Clean technologies: Assessing the impact of adopting electric vehicles, methane capture systems, and renewable energy sources for mine operations. Afforestation offsets: Calculating the amount of land required for tree plantation to offset remaining emissions based on state specific afforestation plan and Carbon emission reduction. Other Renewables: explore alternative use of energy to reduce direct electricity consumption. Any other pathways: Carbon Credits: Estimation of potential Carbon credit earned as per present market rates. Data visualization: The app should present results visually, using charts and graphs to track emission trends and the effectiveness of implemented strategies. Scalability: Design the app to accommodate different mine sizes and types (underground vs open-cast). Benefits: Transparency: Providing a clear picture of a mine's carbon footprint. Decision support: Helping mine operators make informed choices for emission reduction. Cost savings: Identifying opportunities to optimize operations and potentially reduce costs associated with emissions. Sustainability goals: Aiding Indian coal mines in their journey towards carbon neutrality and supporting the country's overall climate goals.

# Prototype Working :

### Expected Solution :

1) To quantify carbon footprints by Indian Coal Mines
2) To implement pathways to neutralize them

We have created a web-based Carbon footprint monitoring System provides real-time Carbon Emissions and Neutrality Pathways, allowing to instantly access carbon footprints by coal mines of pan India. The prototype will function as follows - The Data will be given by given by Contributors or the IoT Devices installed in the Coal Mines. Basically the idea it to get the data from coal mines so it can be quantified. And according to the data accessed from these sources we can give personaised carbon neutralization pathway suggestion to each mine. It works in the two direction :

Firstly the contributors can estimate the data input in the system or it can be precisely estimated by the IoT devices installed in the coal mines, which is also the USP.

Visualize and compare data effortlessly with Data Visualization Tools like heat maps, pictorial displays, bar graphs and line graphs.
Stay informed with our comprehensive Carbon Neutrality Pathways and AI Decision Support System.
Our multi-layered data strategy leverages historical data, providing comprehensive carbon footprints insights using ML prediction model.
IoT Devices and Sensors will be used for real time monitoring and carbon credit management with implementation of Blockchain Technology.
Advanced Geospatial Analysis and Simulation of Clean Technologies to bridge gap between emissions and carbon sinks.
